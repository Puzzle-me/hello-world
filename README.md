hello peeps,

Adis here, and I am a self taught developer. Aside from teaching myself python, C, and SQL,
I am also an artist. My focus is on Painting, but have a strong background in digital art,
drawing, and 3D design. I have also studied Chemistry at Wesleyan University with a focus 
on inorganic chemistry. As such, mathematics and science are a passion and I plan to bring
all of these focuses, art, science, and math into my coding.
